				<p>Perhaps one of the most difficult problems that women deal with is vaginal odor and discomfort. Vaginal odor is caused by the physiological and pathological changes in the body and production of several chemicals in the vagina. Physiological changes include menses or the presence of chemicals related to feminine hygiene, diet, life style, stress, exercise, hormones and harsh cleansing products, which can upset the delicate feminine system and cause embarrassing odor. Pathological changes include infections or the inflammation in response to the foreign material like contraceptive devices etc. Vaginal discharge and odor is a common symptom of these physiological and pathological conditions.</p>

				<p>Feminine odor, regardless of the cause, creates problems that extend beyond the physical aspects of the issue.</p>
			</div>

			<p>Women who are subject to embarrassing vaginal odor understandably find themselves worrying about the social and psychological aspects of the problem. It’s difficult to feel personally confident during social interactions or in intimate situations when unpleasant odors get in the way. Even if these odors are not noticeable to others, their mere presence is enough to destroy a woman’s self-image. Not exactly the topic of casual conversation, many women are unsure of what to do to resolve the problem and which products are not only effective, but safe.</p>

			<p>here are numerous products on the market to stop vaginal odor but many of these products can make the problem worse or create an altogether new problem. Some ingredients contained in these products can upset the balance that a woman’s body maintains and can actually promote more discomfort, making what is obviously an uncomfortable situation, even worse.</p>
